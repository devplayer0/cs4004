# Minesweeper

This project (attempts!) to implement the algorithm described in Chris
Studholme's paper [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cvs/minesweeper/minesweeper.pdf_](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cvs/minesweeper/minesweeper.pdf).
While all the features are technically implemented, it's a bit buggy.

# User interface

Click on squares to uncover them, press "F" while hovering over a square to
flag it. Blue squares are certain to be clear. Red is likely to have a mine,
green unlikely.
